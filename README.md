# jquery plugin which has lots of bugs

this plugin is extracted from my project.
this plugin only works in a specific css environment like `demo/example2.html`.
I don't have enough time to make this full fledged plugin.
Could you tell me if you know a jquery plugin which have same feature.

css design like `demo/expample1.html` doesn't work.
`demo/example2.html` works quite well.
